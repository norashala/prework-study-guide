        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>HTML opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
          <li>lang="en"tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
